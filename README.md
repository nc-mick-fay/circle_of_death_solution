# Circle of Death

100 people stand in a circle. Person 1 has a pistol. He (or she…) shoots Person 2 and then passes the pistol to person number 3, who shoots Person 4 and passes it to Person 5 and so on. When the pistol comes full circle the process continues until only one survivor remains. Which person is that?

Extension 1: what if it’s 1000 people?
Extension 2: What if it’s 1000000000 people?

Note: answers from ex-military know-it-alls who point out that pistols only have ten bullets will not be accepted. This pistol has unlimited ammo.

Now, the thing is, there are all sorts of opportunities to create a very nice object-oriented solution here. So, I guess, can you create a class called CircleOfDeath that nicely models this situation?
Anyone want to have a go?
